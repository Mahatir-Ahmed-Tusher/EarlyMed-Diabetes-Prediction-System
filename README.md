# EarlyMed - Diabetes Prediction System

![Logo](https://i.postimg.cc/8cfd458T/logo.png)

**EarlyMed** is a Senior Design Project developed by a passionate team of students from VIT-AP University. This system predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on health parameters using machine learning. It is designed to assist users in early diagnosis and encourage them to seek professional medical advice.

## Overview

The **Diabetes Prediction System** uses a trained machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on their health parameters. The system is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It also includes feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset Details

### Context
This dataset originates from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)**. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage, a population known to be at higher risk for diabetes.

### Content
The dataset consists of **768 observations** and **9 variables**, including both predictor features and a target variable. 

#### Key Features in the Dataset:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration measured during an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness in mm, an indicator of body fat.
- **Insulin**: Serum insulin level in mu U/ml after 2 hours.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A score indicating the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Patientâ€™s age in years.
- **Outcome**: The target variable, where `0` indicates no diabetes and `1` indicates diabetes.

This structured dataset provides a robust foundation for building predictive models that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes.

- Pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahatir-Ahmed-Tusher/EarlyMed-Diabetes-Prediction-System.git
   cd EarlyMed-Diabetes-Prediction-System
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the App Locally**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Fill out the form with the following health parameters:
   - Pregnancies
   - Glucose
   - Blood Pressure
   - Skin Thickness
   - Insulin
   - BMI
   - Diabetes Pedigree Function
   - Age
3. Click the **Predict** button.
